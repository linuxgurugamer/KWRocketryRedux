Updated to v2.6
-Added:
	- 5m Fairings, nosecones and interstage shrouds.
	- 5m Fuel tanks at L0.5, L1.5, L3.5 sizes.
	- Griffon Century added, a 5m heavy lifting engine.
	- Titan V added, a mid-powered heavy upper stage engine.
	- Globe X-10L & X-10S Inline 2m solid rocket boosters.
	- 5m ASAS.
	- Various extra adapters.
	- Animated 3x2m petal adapter shroud for landers.
	- Larger seperation engine.
	- All fuel tanks remodelled and retextured, 0.5L sizes added to 1-3m.

-Revised:
	- All fuel tanks remodelled and retextured to reduce memory footprint.
	- Fairing textures combined to reduce memory footprint.
	- Existing engines have been converted to the new FX system and utilise various new stock FX.
	- Specular maps have been drastically improved on the majority of parts adding alot more visual depth.
	- Flag decals added to all the longest tanks and the new Globe X-10 series.
	- SPS is now fuelled by monopropellant.
        - Sound effect tweaks.

-Balance
	- All prices reworked to be more inline with stock.
	- Research reworked to be more inline with stock requirements.
	- Minor retweaks to existing engines, srbs and fuel tanks. 1m Vesta engine rebalanced to be more inline with balanced progression.
	- Power response added to engines relative to their role or size. eg. GriffonXX has a relatively slow throttle up time due to it being a large stage 1 lifting engine.

-Misc
	-Textures and sounds moved/combined to reduce memory footprint, where possible.
	-Added an extra top node to the majority of engines, this extra node allows for manual shrouds/adaptershrouds to be placed without triggering the automatic shrouds.
