	// Optional, but recommended
	longDescr = Pood's Patches for KW Rocketry SRBs adjusting dry mass, fuel capacity and thrust to fall in line, more so, with Stock SRBs.  I've always felt that the KW SRBs (mostly the Globe V, VI, X and X-2) could do with some re-balancing as they tend to have way too much thrust for their size when compared to the other SRBs and especially the stock SRBs (minus the RT-5 and R-10 which sit way outside the other motors stats wise). To this end, I tried to find sensible dry mass/volume, fuel capacity/volume and thrust/wet mass ratios, from the stock SRBs and retroactively apply them back to the KW SRBs to try and balance them against the stock game a lot more.  I fell on values of around 0.195t/m^3 for dry mass, around 130 SolidFuel units/m^3 and around 28kN/t for thrust to weight.
