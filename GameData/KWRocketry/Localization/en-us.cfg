"Open Fairing" is self-explanatory, the first "Decouple" option will decouple the main spacecraft and the second will decouple the lander/payload. I recommend binding "Open Fairing" and the first "Decouple" to an action group, performing your transposition and docking and then decoupling the whole spacecraft with the final decouple option. //A deployable 3.75 to 2.5 meter adapter decoupler shroud, perfect for storing landers or other dockable accessories. *As yet we haven't been able to make this work in an ideal way so you must use action groups or right click the part during flight to operate it.
